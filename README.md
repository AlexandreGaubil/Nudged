This app is a proof-of-concept for an app that uses behavioural economic tactics to encourage users to reduce their electricity consumption. It was elaborated for the Fourcaster challenge at the University of Chicago in 2019. It features an algorithm to be able to smartly compare the electrical consumption of different households (e.g., with different areas, number of people, climate conditions, etc.) over time.
